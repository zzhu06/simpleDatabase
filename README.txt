********************** Description **********************
This is a simple database problem from Thumbtack code challenge.

I implement an in-memory database. The program receives commands via standard input (stdin), and has responses to standard output (stout). 

There are 8 commands in the simple database. GET, SET, UNSET, and NUMEQUALTO have expected worst-case runtime of O(log N) or better. 


********************** Instruction **********************    
To test the python code from command line, find the right directory and then enter: python simpleDatabse.py
Enter one command per line.
See the attached txt files for command examples. 

Enjoy! :)
